# Paratus

As in omnia paratus, latin for, prepared in all things or ready for anything.

I'm relearning React Native by building out a simple todo app and working to make it more into a kanban.

## Goals

Mobile app that will have all of the following capabilities. I'd prefer to do this in React Native but if we find out that we cannot do any of these things we'll switch back to Swift :slightly_frowning_face:

* [ ] Create iOS like interface (wheel pickers and the works, such as keyboards that are dismissed when necessary, sheets, tabs, the usual stuff)
* [ ] Single Sign On to Oauth provider (github and google for now)
* [ ] FaceId
* [ ] Local push notifications
* [ ] Data synchronized between iOS and supabase DB
* [ ] offline support that synchronizes once online
